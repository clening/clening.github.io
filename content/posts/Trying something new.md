Rad, so I can just write things in Obsidian and now get the exporter tool to export and save this to a blog with a few git commands?! Fuck yeah.

I want to see how a longer post actually renders.

If you're me the answer is probably 'once a week, for the last 20 years'. It's a common enough occurrence that most of us shrug, and chalk it up to 'shit happens'. Except for that handful of folks who take great umbrage that their inbox has been besoiled by this misdirected missive.

Still, it feels *awful* if you're the poor bastard who sent the email. And it's also mildly nerve-wracking and anxiety-inducing if you're the organization ultimately responsible. I suspect this is why some companies send out an email which blames the poor intern.

A few weeks ago, one of my clients, a medium-sized charity, called me in a bit of a panic after they had unintentionally committed this venial email sin. As part of a marketing appeal, they had sent out a message both to their subscribers and accidentally included around 10,000 people who had previously unsubscribed. Whoops!
